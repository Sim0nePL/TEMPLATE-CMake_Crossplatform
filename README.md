# TEMPLATE-CMake_Crossplatform

This C++ Template is based on CMake and Clang compiler.
- Compiler for Linux is set to **clang++**
- Compiler for Windows is set to **x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang++** from [LLVM-MinGW](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/)

Build system is easily configurable.

On second branch you can see example how to include external libraries like [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
